Hey there! I'm a high school student living in Hawaii that really likes to daydream about doing all sorts of things, and may occasionally begin (and on blue moons, finish) doing some of them.

This blog is my attempt to be a more careful documenter and curator of my life, besides serving as my little place on the net. This is NOT meant to be a portfolio or a professional website.
