I am a landscape architecture student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. My current and prior coursework encompasses site grading/engineering, hydrology, landscape design theory and history, botany, and materials and construction techniques. I am pursuing a minor in restoration ecology and urban planning. I believe that good design makes explicit the relationship between social and environmental justice.

I am also a freelance writer (when I have the time!), covering art and design, film, and environmental issues.

I am profoundly deaf. I wore a unilateral cochlear implant until I was 12, when I had to have it removed due to chronic ear infections. I do not wear any hearing aids. For me, my deafness is a long story of medical and bureaucratic struggle, and of self-discovery and advocacy. To many others, it is simply invisible.

I'm a percussionist and am part of Cal Poly's Polyrhythmics percussion ensemble, which puts on a concert every spring. I also like playing the ukulele.
