My current and prior coursework encompasses site grading/engineering, hydrology, landscape design theory and history, botany, and materials and construction techniques. I am pursuing a minor in restoration ecology to focus on watershed management as a specific area of interest. I believe that good design makes explicit the relationship between social and environmental justice.

As a writer and film programmer, I am particularly passionate about independent and documentary film from the Asia-Pacific region. I try my best to help promote and enrich the critical discourse around filmmaking in/from Hawaii.

I am profoundly deaf. I used to have a unilateral cochlear implant for the better part of my life up until now, but unfortunately had to have it removed a few years ago. I do not wear any hearing aids. For me, my deafness is a long story of medical and bureaucratic struggle, and of self-discovery and advocacy. To many others, it is simply invisible.

I enjoy music a lot, and have been involved in percussion performance for over six years. I also like playing the ukulele.

If you&rsquo;re looking for something, hopefully this site will get you what you need. If not, [shoot me an email](mailto:eygoo@calpoly.edu).
