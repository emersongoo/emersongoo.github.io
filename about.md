I am a landscape architecture student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. My current and prior coursework encompasses site grading/engineering, hydrology, landscape design theory and history, botany, and materials and construction techniques. I am pursuing a minor in restoration ecology to focus on coastal zone and water resources management as extended areas of interest. I believe that good design makes explicit the relationship between social and environmental justice.

I am also an amateur freelance writer, covering art and design, film, and environmental issues.

I am profoundly deaf. I wore a unilateral cochlear implant until I was 12, when I had to have it removed due to chronic ear infections. I do not wear any hearing aids. For me, my deafness is a long story of medical and bureaucratic struggle, and of self-discovery and advocacy. To many others, it is simply invisible.

I have been involved in percussion performance for nearly a decade, and am part of Cal Poly's Polyrhythmics percussion ensemble, which puts on a concert every spring. I also like playing the ukulele.

If you&rsquo;re looking for something, hopefully this site will get you what you need. If not, [shoot me an email](mailto:eygoo@calpoly.edu).
