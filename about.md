I was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. Hawaii is a place often spoken about in terms of periphery and remoteness, but it is the center of my world. I am interested in a design-based approach to moving Hawaii towards a sustainable model of island urbanism. I believe that good landscape design makes explicit the relationships between social and environmental justice.

Beyond my interests in landscape architecture, urban design, and planning, I am deeply passionate about cinema. I aim to contribute to contemporary critical discourse with an eye for how film records the landscapes in and around us. My main focus is independent and/or documentary film from the Asia-Pacific region. I try my best to help promote the local film scene in Hawaii.

I am profoundly deaf. I used to have a unilateral cochlear implant for the better part of my life up until now, but unfortunately had to have it removed a few years ago. I do not wear any hearing aids. For me, my deafness is a long story of medical and bureaucratic struggle, and of self-discovery and advocacy. To many others, it is simply invisible.

I enjoy music a lot, and have been involved in percussion performance for over six years. I also like playing the ukulele.
