This is the first *25 Frames* post. This will be a series of blog posts where I highlight a film and a short sequence from it in 25 still frames or less. No subtitles for dialogue or sound, just images. My goal with these posts is to get people who've never seen the film before interested in it, and that's the primary audience I'm going to be writing to.

Why 25 frames in particular? Well, in deciding how many frames I should use to show the sequence from *Still Life* you see below, I decided to just use the actual frame rate of the film—25 frames per second—as a starting point. It ended up being just the right amount, and the idea stuck. I'm doing this for two reasons:

1. I should probably use my blog for *something*
2. This will help me exercise my writing and film criticism muscles (I hope)

So without further ado, here we go:

*Still Life* is a film situated between the twin poles of creation and destruction. Both processes play out on a larger-than-life scale, with the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (the world's largest power station) set against the demolition and eventual flooding of parts of the city of Fengjie, located within the dam's affected area. As the landscape around the characters hangs in the balance between existence and non-existence, so do two relationships, shown as parallel plots running throughout the film. The first involves Sanming, a coal worker, trying to find his wife and daughter, and the second involves Shen Hong, trying to find her husband.

As [Eric Dalle](https://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc53.2011/dalleStillLife/) points out, this shifting topography of the landscape is what initiates and complicates Sanming and Shen Hong's search for their respective spouses. Homes have already vanished underwater and those still standing are marked for destruction. Perhaps one of the most haunting images in the film occurs when Jia frames a wide shot with a high water mark being painted on the side of a building a few stories up, an indication of where the water will rise to after a certain stage in the project. In doing so, he effectively conveys the speed and violence of these changes—everything we see in that shot will be demolished and flooded.
