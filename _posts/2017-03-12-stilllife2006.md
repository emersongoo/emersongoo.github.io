This is the first *25 Frames* post. This will be a series of blog posts where I highlight a film and a short sequence from it in 25 still frames or less. No subtitles for dialogue or sound, just images. My goal with these posts is to get people who've never seen the film before interested in it, and that's the primary audience I'm going to be writing to.

Why 25 frames in particular? Well, in deciding how many frames I should use to show the sequence from *Still Life* you see below, I decided to just use the actual frame rate of the film—25 frames per second—as a starting point. It ended up being just the right amount, and the idea stuck. I'm doing this for two reasons:

1. I should probably use my blog for *something*
2. This will help me exercise my writing and film criticism muscles (I hope)

So without further ado, here we go:

*Still Life* is a film situated between the twin poles of creation and destruction. Both processes play out on a larger-than-life scale, with the construction of the Three Gorges Dam (the world's largest power station) being set against the demolition and eventual flooding of parts of the city of Fengjie, located within the dam's affected area.
