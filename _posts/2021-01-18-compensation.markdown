For Screen Slate, I wrote about *Compensation*, a film by L.A. Rebellion director Zeinabu irene Davis which follows the parallel Chicago-set stories of two deaf Black women: one in the early 1900s, and one in the 90s. [[External Link: Screen Slate]](https://www.screenslate.com/articles/472)

> Interabled relationships on film are often prone to a sociological pessimism that renders them inherently dysfunctional....But *Compensation* never forgets what it’s really about, and its focus on love as an education — the greatest of them all — reveals it as a gradual, patient, and sometimes comical process of mutual self-advocacy and communication.
