This touring program of shorts made its way to the Cal Poly University Art Gallery earlier this month. Pretty convenient as the screening was held right downstairs from my studio!

Night Watch (2014) by Danaya Chulphuthiphong

The night's black pitch swirls through wide jalousie windows into a turbulence of colors. Through a single architectural element, Chulphuthiphong slips us into a tropical setting obscured from view. She also sets up one of the film's main visual metaphors as individual louvers instantiate the stories of a non-descript office building. The people inside jitter and flit about in fast motion, looking like ants in an ant farm. This motif of the rapid, minute movements and evolutions of tiny creatures and critters is repeated throughout many of the films in the program, and *Night Watch* kicks it all off very capably.
