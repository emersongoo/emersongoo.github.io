I was fortunate and honored to contribute [an essay](https://www.sentientartfilm.com/essays-2/after-image) to Sentient.Art.Film's year-long series showcasing 1990s Asian American film & video. A revival of a shorter program run last year, this new iteration includes the full *Blindness Series* by Tran T. Kim-Trang. I grappled with the use of disability as metaphor throughout the series, which was at times confining, at others rewarding.

> In an artist’s statement, Tran lists another, less apparent motivation for committing to such an expansive project: a personal fear of vision loss. With this in mind, a palpable anxiety sets in while viewing the films. Just as Roland Barthes’ Camera Lucida arose from an obsession with death and the loss of his mother, the Blindness Series might be taken as an obsessive work, an attempt to shore up an archive of blindness against its unknowability.
