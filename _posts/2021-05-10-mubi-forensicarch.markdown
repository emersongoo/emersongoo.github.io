My first MUBI article, which dives into the documentary films of Forensic Architecture and the limitations of their rhetorical style. [[External Link: MUBI]](https://mubi.com/notebook/posts/remains-to-be-seen-the-video-work-of-forensic-architecture)

> It is easy to be impressed by how FA demystifies, in a scientific and rational manner, the Rashomon-like cases they handle. But have they actually effected material change for the subjects of their films and investigations? I am not talking about the results of inquests or convictions, but whether FA’s “counter-forensics” dismantle the structures of power they utilize and operate within.
