For Screen Slate, I wrote about *Untamagiru* by the Okinawan director Go Takamine. Political revolution, on island time. [[External Link: Screen Slate]](https://www.screenslate.com/articles/untamagiru)

> Set in Okinawa just before the reversion, *Untamagiru* practically radiates *chirudai* while remaining sharply political. Tony Rayns called it agit-prop at its most “spaced-out,” and its down-tempo, almost disinterested magical realist plot is both far weirder and more ordinary than any written description can capture.
